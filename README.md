# Bulletproofs over the Canaan curve

This repo builds over [Bulletproofs][bp_website] but replaces the 
Ristretto group with another group over a newly sampled curve, named Canaan, 
found through the use of the complex multiplication by  Broker and Stevenhagen.

An important property of the Canaan curve is that it can embed secp256k1. A severe
limitation, as a result, is that its scalar field does not have a lot of 
2-arity, and therefore preventing a large class of protocols based on FFT
to run on the native field.

There are only a few solutions we know today to circumvent this limitation: 
Bulletproofs, Gemini, and Orion. For this library, we use Bulletproofs.
